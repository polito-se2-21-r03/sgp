# SPG - TEAM R03

## Project architecture
The project is divided into two independent containers (services). The first, called server listening on port 3001, is dedicated solely to the backend stuff or to everything related to the business logic exposed through api.
The second one, called frontend or client, is the interface exposed to the user and accessible to the localhost:3000 page that communicates with the backend.

## Order status meaning
- Created: it has been created
- Pending: the order has been accepted
- Issued
- Delivered
- Completed
- Pending cancelation: the client has insufficient balance
## Tech

The application is built using the following technologies:

- [Express] - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
- [Sqlite3] - SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.
- [Sequelize] - Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. 
- [Polaris] - Our design system helps us work together to build a great experience for all of Shopifyâ€™s merchants.
- [Jest] - Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
- [NodeJs] - As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications.

## Installation

> The following release tags has the final number variable which varies based on the release number.
It can be for example release1 for the first release or release2 for the second one

```sh
docker run -d --network="host" --name backend  francescomedina/se2-r03-spg-server:release1
